      <p>Hello! I’m Mercedes Gilder, an upcoming Junior majoring in Physics. I’m passionate about exploring the intersections of science, technology, and the law.</p>

      <p>My journey has been shaped by the importance of perseverance and support. Raised with the value of giving generously, I’ve learned the power of resilience, with my father as my steadfast supporter. One of my dreams is to help him realize his retirement vision of living in Imperial Beach.</p>

      <p>My interest in medical physics is deeply personal, inspired by a family history touched by cancer — from my former stepmother’s battle with ovarian cancer, to close family and friends who have faced this disease. This experience fuels my desire to innovate and make a real impact in healthcare, especially as many become desensitized to cancer until it affects someone close.</p>

      <p>Ultimately, I want to be a role model for my younger brothers, peers, and women of color who, like me, may not always see themselves represented in science and academia.</p>

      <p>While I’m leaning toward pursuing graduate studies in medical physics, I’m also considering law school with a focus on intellectual property. I plan to gain valuable professional experience in electrical engineering after my bachelor’s degree, which I believe will strengthen my understanding and career prospects in both fields.</p>

      <p>In my free time, I enjoy writing, academic exploration, and reflecting on the beautiful ways science and art come together.</p>
